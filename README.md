mvn-repo
========

Personal repository for some open source projects that I've included in some builds but don't have a public repository anywhere.

You really shouldn't rely on anything in this repo staying available; this is just for my own projects.

Contains:
* http://code.google.com/p/language-detection/ - a language detection library
* http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ - a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining
